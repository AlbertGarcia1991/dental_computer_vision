1) Draw tooth bboxes and centres from json data into images
2) Draw tooth contours around from json data into images
3) Label tooth number based on:
    3.1) Inferior or Superior based on location (centre or central edge of bbox)
    3.2) Count from center line tooth, based on average distances along X (width)
    3.3) Apply symmetry and diff map for each two pairs to find symmetric teeth
    3.4) Play with histograms and basic filters to enhance this feature
4) Store bboxes for each tooth with its img source and tooth number
5) Store contours (with contrast colour on background) for each tooth with its img source and tooth number
6) Check for special labels: implants, fillers, posts, crowns, ...
7) Play with full images on image processing techniques
    7.1) Locate Right side of the image
    7.2) Locate tooth parts: crown, neck, root, enamel, dentine, pulp, root canal, root apex, number of roots
    7.3) Label aforementioned parts and store as segmented regions
    7.4) Bone (mandible) detection and sizing
8) ML
    8.1) Tooth vs No Tooth detection using CNN
    8.2) Tooth bbox using RCNN and YOLO techniques
    8.3) Tooth segmentation using Transformers
9) Disease identification from panoramic X-Rays
